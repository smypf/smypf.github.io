            <p>I had an idea for something that I wanted to put together. Nothing special or complex and I it laid out in
            my head.</p>

            <p>I'd been mucking around with how data storage would be done and after a little bit I had it in a place that I
            was happy.</p>

            <p>But then I needed to put a frontend together and that's where the wheels came off.</p>

            <p>First I thought I'd do it with as little Javascript as possible. Then I thought that would be a pain and
            decided to start learning Svelte as an alternative frontend library. I started looking into how to do testing
            and found that was a bit all over the place and I'd be missing out on improving my knowledge there.</p>

            <p>Then that seemed too hard and instead I thought I'd start with a fresh installation of React as it's a
            library I'm more familiar with.</p>

            <p>By that time I was overwhelmed and anxious and had nothing to show for the hour or so of umm'ing and ahh'ing
            I'd gone through. I'd wasted the short amount of time I had to do something worrying about things that in the
            long run didn't really matter</p>

            <p>This upset me greatly. I've decided that to get over it I'm committing to producing something new <strike>for the
            next 30 days</strike> regularily.</p>

            <p>The rules:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strike>Each day</strike> When you can create something new. It can be completely from scratch or an enhancement to something existing.</li>
                <li>Put it online. It if's not something that someone else can witness it doesn't count.</li>
                <li>It doesn't matter what it is. An article, a toy application, just messing around with the design of this
                    site or anything else I feel like.</li>
                <li>No meta-bullshit. Changes to the formatting, messing around with configuration or anything else that an
                    end user would care about doesn't count.</li>
                <li>It doesn't have to be good. The exercise of putting something together is the goal.</li>
                <li>Incomplete work is better than no work at all. As long as it's online it's good enough</li>
                <li>Everything that is done gets listed somewhere on this site. Right now there's space on the
                    <a href="/">home page</a> so that's where it lives right now.</li>
                <li>Focus on getting one part right. Improve the next part after that.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Edit - 1 Apr 2022: So the every day thing didn't happen. Life got in the way. Whatever... I've still found enjoyment out of creating. I've relaxed the rules to make them more realistic for me.</p>
